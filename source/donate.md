If you find [Murray's Blog](https://blog.ligos.net) useful, and you'd like to contribute to hosting costs, server upkeep and paying my bills, you can donate via paypal or bitcoin below.

Note that this blog will never charge money for people to use or access content. 
If you don't want to give me money, there is nothing compelling you to do so (legally, ethically, morally or technically).
See the [about](/about.html) page for more information.

If you'd like to say *thank you* without any dollars changing hands, that's fine, head over to the [contact](/contact.html) page.
