The best way to contact Murray is via **email** [blog@ligos.net](mailto:blog@ligos.net)

The **comments** section below each post is perfect for, well, comments about a post.

Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter and [Keybase](https://keybase.io/ligos) are also available. And highly unlikely to get my attention. 

I cannot promise to respond to every question or comment, but I do read everything.

## Things That Will Never Receive a Response

* **Requests to link to your commercial site** - I chose my links on my own, commercial kick backs don't happen. Ever.
* **Requests to link to your irrelevant site** - I chose my links on my own, they need to contribute to my content.
* **Requests to add content** - I chose what content I add, suggestions for additional content are (almost) always unwelcome.
* **Requests to make guest posts** - I am the sole author of this blog, there are no guest posts or contributing authors. Ever.
* **Requests to improve my search ranking** - I really don't care that much about search rankings.
* **Spam and other commercial material** - I have no need of commercial kick backs. Don't bother offering.
