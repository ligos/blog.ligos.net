## About the Author

I'm Murray. A thirty something male, living in Sydney, Australia.
  
I'm a husband, father, brother, evangelical Christian, Bible study leader, occasional preacher, programmer, database administrator, performance analyst, general IT assistant for family.
And probably a whole bunch of other titles, but that will do for now. 

Professionally, I work for [Far Edge Technology](http://www.faredge.com.au), mostly developing [Wise Owl Legal](http://www.wiseowllegal.com.au).  

I serve at [Wenty Anglican Church](http://www.wentworthville.anglican.asn.au/) where I was converted as a young adult.

I play computer games infrequently by myself, and regularly with my son (who is obsessed with [lego games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Marvel_Super_Heroes)).

I maintain a small, if unusually robust, home network.
Which hosts this blog and [MakeMeAPassword.org](https://makemeapassword.org).
