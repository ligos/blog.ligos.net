## About the Author

I'm Murray. A forty something male, living in Sydney, Australia.
  
I'm a husband, father, brother, evangelical Christian, Bible study leader, occasional preacher, Church Warden, programmer, database administrator, performance analyst, general IT assistant for family.
And probably a whole bunch of other titles, but that will do for now. 

Professionally, I work for [WiseTech Global](http://wisetechglobal.com) developing software for the logistics industry.  

I serve at [Wenty Anglican Church](http://wentyanglican.org.au/) where I was converted as a young adult.

I play computer games infrequently by myself, and regularly with my sons (Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite).

I maintain a small, if unusually robust, home network.
Which hosts this blog and [MakeMeAPassword.ligos.net](https://makemeapassword.ligos.net).
