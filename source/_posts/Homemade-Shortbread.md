Butter + Sugar = Yummy

<!-- more --> 

## Background

My grandmother on my mum's side made the best shortbread.
And I took to making it based on her recipe (although my shortbread just isn't as good as hers).

It make a fantastic gift at any time of the year, and this year I'll be making it for friends and family and a Christmas gift.

Here's the recipe, for everyone's benefit (and so I don't forget).

## Homemade Shortbread

A quick and easy recipe for real butter shortbread.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup plain flour (if using gluten free, add 1/4 cup more)
* 1/2 cup cornflour
* 2/3 cup castor sugar
* 150g salted butter, slightly softened

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 140°C (120°C fan forced).
2. Sift and combine flour and sugar in mixing bowl.
3. Cut butter into small pieces and rub into mixture until dough is formed.
4. Cut and shape into 16 thick biscuits.
5. Bake for 25-35 minutes on low heat; taking care not to overcook.
6. Leave to cool before serving.


## Hints

* A cooler oven is best. Mine is hot and I cook on 100°C.
* Too much butter makes the biscuits burn and kind of melt into each other.
* Too much flour makes the biscuits, well, floury.
* Gluten free flour can be used, add a little more if using it.
* I haven't found an acceptable dairy free substitute for butter.
* Eat them slowly. One at a time. Savour every crumb!

## Pictures

Because it didn't happen unless there are pictures!
(And I need extra help when cooking).

## Conclusion

Shortbread is yummy.
Although lets face it, when the main ingredients are butter and sugar, it's pretty hard to go wrong.

The only down side is the number of kilometers you need to run / walk / swim / cycle to burn off those oh so yummy biscuits.
